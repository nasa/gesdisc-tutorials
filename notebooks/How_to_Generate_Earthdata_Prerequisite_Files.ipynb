    "# How to Generate Earthdata Prerequisite Files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates how to generate three Earthdata prerequisite files (.netrc, .urs_cookies, .dodsrc) needed to access the GES DISC archives manually, or through Python. It uses native Python libraries to generate the files in either Windows/macOS/Linux environments and to place them in their appropriate folders. Additionally, it demonstrates how to retrieve an Earthdata Login token for use with the `Pydap` Python library.\n",
