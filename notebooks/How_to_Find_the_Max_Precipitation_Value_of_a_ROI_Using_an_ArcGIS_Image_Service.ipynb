    "# How to Find the Max Precipitation Value of an ROI Using an ArcGIS Image Service\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to inform the user on how to find the maximum precipitation rate (mm/hr) using an ArcGIS image service as data input, via a Jupyter Notebook (JN) for a defined Region of Interest (ROI). The ArcGIS image service used in the notebook is the \"[GPM_3IMERGHHE_06 (ImageServer)](https://arcgis.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/authoritative/rest/services/GPM_3IMERGHHE_06/ImageServer)\" ArcGIS REST service [(Huffman et. al., 2019)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/GPM_3IMERGHH_06/summary).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Python3 coding environment, such as an updated, local instantce of ESRI ArcGIS Pro (desktop), Visual Studio Code/VS Code (desktop), ESRI ArcGIS Enterprise (web), Jupyter Notebook (web), Google Colaboratory (web), a shell/terminal/command-line such as IPython in the command window (desktop), and several other options. Though many interfaces can be used, the code has been tested in the aforementioned environments. This notebook was written using Python 3.9, and requires these libraries and files: [tornado](https://pypi.org/project/tornado/) and [arcgis](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/).   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. This notebook requires having the latest versions of the \"arcgis\" python API and \"datetime\" python module. If running the JN in Google Colaboratory, you will also need to have the latest version of the \"tornado\" Python web framework. If you don't have these versions, you can install them using the instructions in Step 3 (below) in this prerequisites section. Some environments (e.g. - ESRI ArcGIS Pro) are packaged automatically with the arcgis library, and don't require a separate installation. If you are unsure what libraries you are require to install, run the JN with the code as-is in the desired environment. A runtime error should appear and specify which Python modules it cannot access and need to be installed. If no errors appear, then you are all set to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Methods to install these libraries can vary, depending on your coding environment. You will need to use the conda, and/or pip packaging tools, to install the required Python libraries to your environment. You can use the optional lines of code in the first cell of the JN to install the libraries to your environment, or you can install the needed libraries locally using the Windows command line. For the former, the lines in the JN are currently inactive (\"commented-out\"), and can be selectively activated based on your unique situation by removing the hastag symbols. For the latter, please see an example of this for use in Visual Studio Code in the \"Additional Info\" section. Also note, if you are using Anaconda as your default Python installation, you will need to use both \"pip\" and \"conda\" packaging tools to install the arcgis library."

    "### 1. Environment Setup and Importing Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file attached to this How-to and save it to your computer in an accessible folder (it will have a “.ipynb” file extension). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open your .ipynb file in the desired interface/environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Please see the \"Prerequisites\" section before proceeding. If you already have the required libraries installed, be sure they are the latest versions; if not, update them.\n",

    "4. Once you have completed the above steps, run the first cell of the JN to import the modules for the subsequent cells:"
