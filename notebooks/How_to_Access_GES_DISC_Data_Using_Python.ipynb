    "<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">Please, be very judicious when working on long data time series residing on a remote data server.<br />\n",
    "It is very likely that attempts to apply similar approaches on remote data, such as hourly data, for more than a year of data at a time, will result in a heavy load on the remote data server. This may lead to negative consequences, ranging from very slow performance that will be experienced by hundreds of other users, up to denial of service.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to work with GES DISC data resources using Python. For example, the data can accessed using [techniques that rely on a native Python code](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Still, there are several third-party libraries that can further simplify the access. In the sections below, we describe three techniques that make use of Requests, Pydap, and Xarray libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was written using Python 3.8, and requires these libraries and files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `netrc` file with valid Earthdata Login credentials\n",
    "   - [How to Generate Earthdata Prerequisite Files](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/information/howto?title=How%20to%20Generate%20Earthdata%20Prerequisite%20Files)\n",
    "- [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) (version 2.22.0 or later)\n",
    "- [pydap](https://www.pydap.org/en/latest/) (we recommend using version 3.2.1)\n",
    "- [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/)\n",
    "- [netCDF4-python](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python) (we recommend using version 1.6.2)"
